                <p>My name is Angel Martinez and I am 25 years old. There is a lot of things to know about me but it would take a whole essay to describe myself so I'll try my best to do it in two! I have a husky named King which I love very much and I don't know what I'll do without him. Currently am attending UCF finishing my degree in Economics. One of my passions in life are sports. I dont't really play sports anymore but I was a legit football prospect back in high school. I like pretty much every sport but football is my passion. My favorite team is the New England Patriots. I grew up watching the team play every Sunday since I was a little kid. I visit the New England area at least 5 times per year to catch a game and also because is one of my favorite places on Earth. From Maine to Connecticut, you'll find beauty in every corner.</p>
